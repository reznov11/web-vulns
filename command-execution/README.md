		  Notice, that you have just to add the ip that hosting the script and choose one of 

		  these levels to accomplish the process:

		  ("high", "medium", "low").

		  Eventually, you can find the results inside an html file called parse.html,

		  here is an example from my terminal :

          xakep@pentester:~/Desktop/myscripts/owasp/web-vulns/cexecution$ python cexecution.py 192.168.43.5 low
