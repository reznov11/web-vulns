		  Notice, that you have just to pick one of these levels to accomplish the proccess:

		  ("high", "medium", "low").

		  At the end, you can find the results inside an html file called parse.html,

		  here is an example from my terminal :

          xakep@pentester:~/Desktop/myscripts/owasp/web-vulns/cexecution$ python cexecution.py low
          
		   ______     ____        ___    
		  |  _ \ \   / /\ \      / / \   
		  | | | \ \ / /  \ \ /\ / / _ \  
		  | |_| |\ V /    \ V  V / ___ \ 
		  |____/  \_/      \_/\_/_/   \_\

		   ____             _       _____
